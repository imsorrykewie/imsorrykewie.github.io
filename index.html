                    <section>
                        <h2>Dear kewie,</h2>
                        <p>
                            I've never been too artistic, so I don't know how to best express my feelings.<br>
                            I ended up doing this. I've never made an actual website before, so I'm sorry if it sucks.<br>
                            Turns out you need to learn three programming languages just to make a simple website<br>
                            I've been suffering. Feels like I've been stabbed in the chest every time I see our memories.<br>
                            But it's okay.<br>
                            You were always kind and cared for me, so I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt me this much when you left.<br>
                            Making this helped me let out some of my emotions and distract me from the pain.<br>
                            It made me feel like I was talking with you again.
                        </p>

                        <h2>But... Why?</h2>
                        <p>
                            You're probably wondering why I'm going through this much effort. <br>
                            We've never met,<br>
                            never seen how we look like,<br>
                            never heard each other's voices.<br>
                            Well, at first I didn't really know why I was doing this either.<br>
                            I didn't know how I grew to be so attached to this friendship, or how I talked with you every day,
                            or how I ended up spending some of my most precious moments with you.<br>
                            I didn't know why you left so abruptly, and tossed away everything without wanting to talk at all.<br>
                            Everything was a blur.<br>
                            I have spent the past few months searching for answers,<br>
                            looking at what happened between us and where it all went wrong.<br>
                            I'm trying so hard because I want to show how much you mattered to me.<br>
                            If there was anything I could do to be friends again, I wouldn't hesitate for a moment.<br>
                            I want to show you how much effort I am willing to make to improve myself,<br>
                            and to get back with you, and make sure you always feel respected as a person and as a dear friend.<br>
                            I guess I just don't want you to leave thinking I'm a bad person,<br>
                            and maybe hold on to the hope that you could give this friendship another chance.<br>
                            I made this in the hopes that you could understand me, and why I sometimes behaved the way I did,<br>
                            which caused tensions in our friendship and ultimately made you leave.<br>
                            I hope you can find the time, enjoy the songs, and journey through my story.

                            <h2>My Life Before</h2>
                            <p>
                                Having no siblings, I've always been faced with some high expectations from family.<br>
                                They were nice, but also strict.<br>
                                Throughout elementary and middle school, I tried keeping up the image of a good student, even though nothing really mattered back then.
                                People ended up having expectations of me that I never wanted. <br>
                                I was always stressed and overworking myself.
                            </p>
                            <div class="inline-container">
                                <img src="lonely.jpg" id="lonely"></img>
                                <p>
                                    I coped in some pretty unhealthy ways. I stopped going out as much and stayed up late every night.<br>
                                    I let my emotions build up and left all the issues in life for future me.<br>
                                    I did have a few friends,<br>
                                    but never someone I could open up to.<br>
                                    I wanted people to know me better. <br>
                                    Because if they did,<br>
                                    then maybe they could understand my problems.<br>
                                    And I wouldn't feel so lonely.<br>
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                I turned to online games for my loneliness. Meeting random people online was better than having nobody at all.<br>
                                It somewhat at first, I could talk to people I've never met and distract myself from the world.<br>
                                I didn't have to conform to any expectations or face any responsibilities at all.<br>
                                But that never really solved the problem, and I knew inside that internet strangers would never be able to truly understand me.<br>
                                ...Or at least that's what I thought.

                                <div class="inline-container">
                                    <p>
                                        It was purely by chance that I met you. I never expected our friendship to grow so fast.<br>
                                        Talking to you brought me joy like never before.<br>
                                        I still remember us staying up talking about nerdy topics until late at night,
                                        or casually chatting about our lives while doing nothing in particular.<br>
                                        I don't really know what happened to casper, we kind of just stopped talking, but I loved our time together too.<br>
                                        I enjoyed our conversations so much that I was playing the game just to talk with you.<br>
                                        You even took the time to log on just to say happy birthday to me.<br>
                                        Thank you.
                                    </p>

                                </div>
                            <p>
                                I don't really know exactly how either, but I felt like I could open up to you and really trusted you.<br>
                                Maybe because I didn't have to be scared of showing my insecurities to people I see every day and being judged.<br>
                                And then we got discord and had over 1,000 messages in the first day. It was really amazing.<br>
                                I had someone to accompany me throughout the day, someone to share happy moments with, someone to turn to when I'm down,
                                someone I could connect to. I no longer had to bottle up all my emotions.<br>
                                When I was talking with you, I felt genuinely happy.<br>
                                I really loved our moments together and appreciated all the things you were able to do with me.<br>
                                I had found someone who could understand me.<br>
                                I hoped we could stay this way forever.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I know it wasn't always perfect.<br>
                                At first, we had fights every few weeks.<br>
                                It was always tough, but in the end I felt we gained a deeper understanding into each other.<br>
                                I really tried listening to your concerns and changing myself.
                                There were many times when I wanted to do things with you, but decided not to force it because you were busy or had other things.<br>
                                Our fights became less and less frequent, and we were able to address the problems when we did.<br>
                                They turned from every few weeks to a month to every other month. Our last ones were over 3 months apart.<br>
                                So I just hope you can see that I really was trying.<br>
                                <br>
                                But I guess I couldn't change fast enough.

                            <p>
                                I guess I just didn't expect you to say goodbye so suddenly.<br>
                                At the time, I thought our friendship was pretty solid and stable.<br>
                                I thought you were enjoying it as much as I did, but looking back I guess there were cracks I couldn't notice.<br>
                                We hadn't done anything for a month, and at the time I was also going through some really stressful things.<br>
                                College deadlines were closing in and some classes weren't ideal.<br>
                                I felt as if things were turning back to before I met you, and that we were drifting apart from each other.<br>
                                It was a time when I really needed you, so when I found out that I slept through the little window of time when you were finally free...<br>
                                <br>
                                I'm sorry.<br>
                                <br>
                                I did and said things I should not have.<br>
                                I made you feel uncomfortable and crossed the line.<br>
                                Right before you left, you said you didn't feel like you and your boundaries were being respected.<br>
                                Those words echo inside me every day.<br>
                                I'm sorry I wasn't able to provide you with a friendship you could be comfortable in, unlike what you did for me.<br>
                                I wish we would have communicated more, maybe none of this would have happened and we would be enjoying our breaks doing all the things we loved together.<br>
                                But sadly time doesn't go back.

                                I coped in some destructive ways.<br>
                                I made everyone worry.<br>
                                I questioned the meaning of everything.<br>
                                I realized I had it all wrong.

                                    Thanks to some help, I've pulled myself back a little.<br>
                                    But it has been a painful journey without you.<br>
                                    I've been looking through our memories every day.<br>
                                    I've been finding fragments of our relationship in everything I do.<br>
                                    I just want to talk like we used to.<br>
                                    I want to be there for you like you did for me.<br>
                                    I really hope you can see how much effort I'm willing to put in to make things better.<br>
                                    I promise I'll do everything I can to respect your boundaries and listen to your concerns.
                                    So please give me another chance.<br>
                                    I don't want to keep convincing myself that this relationship should have ended then.<br>
                                    I don't want to pretend that it was all a fantasy.<br>
                                    Because every moment with you mattered to me,<br>
                                    and I'm willing to do anything to change things from the way it is now.
                                </p>
