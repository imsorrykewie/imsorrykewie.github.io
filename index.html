                        <h2>Dear kewie,</h2>
                        <p>
                            Before I say anything else, I just want to thank you for all the things we were able to do and the days we were able to spend together.
                            They were truly amazing, and I wish each day with you could have lasted longer.<br>
                            I'm glad I met you.<br>
                            It's been two months, and life hasn't been the same since.<br>
                            I've never been too artistic, so I don't know how to best express my feelings and ended up doing this.<br>
                            I've also never made an actual website before, I'm sorry if it sucks.
                            It turns out you need to learn three programming languages just to make a simple website.<br>
                            I've been suffering. It feels like I'm being stabbed in the chest every day.<br>
                            But it's okay.<br>
                            You were always kind and cared for me, so I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt me this much when you left.<br>
                            I hope you were able to be happy this whole time. At least then I can find some meaning in my pain.<br>
                            Making this helped me let out some of my emotions and distract me.<br>
                            It made me feel like I was talking with you again, when things were simple and nice.<br>
                            Kewie...<br>
                            I'm really doing everything I can, so please reconsider.<br>
                            I've really grown a lot, and I wish we could be a part of each other's stories again.
                        </p>

                        <h2>But... Why?</h2>
                        <p>
                            We've never actually met,<br>
                            never seen how we look like,<br>
                            never heard each other's voices.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You're probably wondering why I'm going through all of this effort.<br>
                            At first I didn't know why I was doing this either.
                            I didn't know how I grew to be so attached to this friendship, or how I talked with you every day,
                            or how I ended up spending some of my most precious moments with you.<br>
                            I didn't know why you left so abruptly, and tossed away everything without wanting to talk at all.<br>
                            Everything was a blur.<br>
                            I have spent the past few months searching for answers, collecting our memories,
                            looking at what happened between us and where it all went wrong.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm trying so hard because I want to show how much you mattered to me.<br>
                            I'm sure you didn't want everything to turn out this way either, with everything we've been through together.<br>
                            I'm sorry for ruining everything.<br>
                            But you were a vital part of my life the past two years, and if there is anything I could do to continue our friendship,
                            I wouldn't hesitate for a single moment.<br>
                            I want to show you how much effort I am willing to make to improve myself,<br>
                            to get back with you and make sure you always feel respected as a person and as a dear friend.<br>
                            I really want to make this work again, so please believe in me.<br>
                            I keep my promises.<br>
                            I guess I also don't want you to leave thinking I'm a bad person.<br>
                            I want to hold on to the hope that you could give this friendship another chance.<br>
                            I've been writing down my daily stories,<br>
                            wondering if I could finally share them with you again someday.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I made this in the hopes that you could understand me, and why I sometimes behaved the way I did,<br>
                            which caused tensions in our friendship and ultimately made you leave.<br>
                            I hope you can journey through my story, or at least enjoy my playlist while scrolling through,
                            because it took me a while to figure out how to make everything.<br>
                            I miss you.<br>
                            Wherever you are.<br>
                        </p>

                            <h2>My Life Before</h2>
                            <p>
                                Having no siblings, I've always been faced with some high expectations from family.<br>
                                They were nice, but also strict.<br>
                                I also moved a lot, so I never had a typical childhood or a childhood friend.<br>
                                No pony with misspelled cake or trips to places that don't exist on the map.<br>
                                Throughout elementary and middle school, I kept up the image of a good student, even though nothing really mattered back then.
                                People ended up having expectations of me that I never wanted.<br>
                                I was always stressed and overworking myself.
                            </p>
                            <div class="inline-container">
                                <img src="lonely.jpg" id="lonely"></img>
                                <p>
                                    I coped in some pretty unhealthy ways. I stopped going out as much and stayed up late every night.<br>
                                    I let my emotions build up and left all the issues in life for future me.<br>
                                    I did have a few friends, but never someone I could open up to.<br>
                                    I wanted people to know me better.<br>
                                    Because if they did,<br>
                                    then maybe they could understand my problems.<br>
                                    And I wouldn't feel so lonely anymore.<br>
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                I turned to video games for my loneliness. Meeting random people online was better than having nobody at all.<br>
                                It worked at first, I could immerse myself, talk to people I've never met, and distract myself from the world.<br>
                                I didn't have to conform to any expectations or face any responsibilities.<br>
                                But that never really solved the problem, and I knew inside that internet strangers would never be able to truly understand me.<br>
                                ...Or at least that's what I thought.

                                    <p>
                                        Our encounter was purely by chance. I never expected our friendship to grow so fast.<br>
                                        Talking to you brought me joy like never before.<br>
                                        I still remember us staying up talking about all the nerdy topics until late at night,
                                        or casually chatting about our lives while doing nothing in particular.<br>
                                        I don't really know what happened to casper, we kind of just stopped talking, but I loved our time together too.<br>
                                        I enjoyed our conversations so much that I was playing the game just to talk with you.<br>
                                        You even took the time to log on just to say happy birthday to me, when even a lot of my friends forgot.<br>
                                        Thank you.
                                    </p>

                            <p>
                                I don't know exactly how either, but I felt like I could open up to you.
                                Maybe because I didn't have to be scared of showing my insecurities to the people see every day or worry about being judged.<br>
                                And then we got discord and had over 1,000 messages in the first day.<br>
                                I've always wanted an online best friend. This became more than I could have ever asked for.<br>
                                We were inseparable, and for once, everything in life was just wonderful.<br>
                                I had someone to accompany me throughout the day, someone to share happy moments with, someone to turn to when I'm down,
                                someone I could connect to. I no longer had to bottle up all my emotions.<br>
                                When I was talking with you, I felt genuinely happy.<br>
                                I really loved our moments together and appreciated all the things you were able to do with me.<br>
                                There was finally someone who could understand me.<br>
                                I wished we could stay this way forever.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I know it wasn't always perfect.<br>
                                At first, we had small fights every few weeks.<br>
                                It was always tough, but in the end I felt we gained a deeper understanding of each other.<br>
                                I really tried listening to your concerns and changing myself.
                                There were many times when I wanted to do things with you, but decided not to force it because you were busy or had other things.<br>
                                I guess I'm a bit insecure about missing out on things.<br>
                                But our fights became less and less frequent, and we were able to address the problems when we did.<br>
                                They turned from every few weeks to a month to every other month. Our last ones were 3 months apart.<br>
                                So I just hope you can see that I really was trying.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I couldn't change fast enough.

                            <h2>When You Left</h2>
                            <p>
                                I didn't expect you to say goodbye so suddenly.
                                At the time, I thought our friendship was pretty solid and stable.<br>
                                I thought you were enjoying it as much as I did, but looking back, there were cracks I couldn't notice.<br>
                                We hadn't done anything for a month, and at the time I was also going through some really stressful things.<br>
                                College deadlines were closing in and some classes weren't ideal, as well as things going on with family too.<br>
                                I felt that we were drifting apart from each other. It was as if things were turning back to before I met you.<br>
                                It was a time when I really needed you, so when I found out that I slept through the little window of time when you were finally able to do things...<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm sorry.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I did and said things I should not have.<br>
                                I just really, really wanted to finally spend some time with you again. I hope you can understand.<br>
                                But that doesn't mean my behavior was justified. I made you uncomfortable and crossed the line.<br>
                                I'm sorry I treated you as just someone behind a screen to play games and watch shows with.<br>
                                I failed to consider your feelings and failed as a friend.<br>
                                I'm really, really, really sorry.<br>
                                Right before you left, you said you didn't feel like you and your boundaries were being respected.<br>
                                Those words echo inside me every day.<br>
                                I'm sorry I wasn't able to provide you with a friendship you could be comfortable in, unlike what you did for me.<br>
                                I wish we would have communicated more, maybe none of this would have happened. Maybe we would be enjoying our breaks doing all the things we loved together.<br>
                                Maybe.<br>
                                But sadly time doesn't go back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I coped in some destructive ways.<br>
                                I made everyone worry.<br>
                                I questioned everything.<br>
                                I realized I had it all wrong.
                            </p>

                                <p>
                                    Thanks to some help, I've gotten back up a little.<br>
                                    But it has been a painful journey without you.<br>
                                    I've been looking through our memories every day, finding fragments of our friendship everywhere I go.<br>
                                    Everything feels hollow now.<br>
                                    I just want to talk like we used to.<br>
                                    I want to be there for you like you did for me.<br>
                                    I really hope you can see how much effort I'm willing to put in to make things better.<br>
                                    I promise I'll do everything I can to respect your boundaries and listen to your concerns.
                                    So please give me another chance.<br>
                                    I don't want to keep convincing myself that this relationship should have ended then.<br>
                                    I don't want to pretend that it was all a fantasy.<br>
                                    Because every moment with you mattered to me,<br>
                                    and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to change things from the way it is now.
                                </p>

                                Let's rebuild the friendship that we loved,<br>
                                and turn it into something we've always wanted it to be.<br>
                                Together.<br>
                                I promise you won't regret it.
